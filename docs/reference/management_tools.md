:::{grid-item-card} [AMD SMI](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/projects/amdsmi/en/latest/)
GO AMD SMI provides GO binding for [E-SMI In-Band C library](https://github.com/amd/esmi_ib_library.git),
[ROCm SMI Library](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/rocm_smi_lib.git), and any
GO language application that needs to link with these libraries and call the APIs
from the GO application. The GO binding are imported in the
[AMD SMI Exporter](https://github.com/amd/amd_smi_exporter.git) to export information
provided by the AMD E-SMI inband library and the ROCm SMI GPU library to the Prometheus server.

This tool acts as a command line interface for manipulating and monitoring the amdgpu kernel, and is intended to replace and deprecate the existing rocm_smi.py CLI tool. It uses Ctypes to call the rocm_smi_lib API.
