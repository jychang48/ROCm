# Compiler Reference Guide

## Introduction to Compiler Reference Guide

ROCmCC is a Clang/LLVM-based compiler. It is optimized for high-performance
computing on AMD GPUs and CPUs and supports various heterogeneous programming
models such as HIP, OpenMP, and OpenCL.

ROCmCC is made available via two packages: `rocm-llvm` and `rocm-llvm-alt`.
The differences are listed in [the table below](rocm-llvm-vs-alt).

### ROCm Compiler Interfaces

ROCm currently provides two compiler interfaces for compiling HIP programs:

- `/opt/rocm/bin/hipcc`
- `/opt/rocm/bin/amdclang++`

Both leverage the same LLVM compiler technology with the AMD GCN GPU support;
however, they offer a slightly different user experience. The hipcc command-line
interface aims to provide a more familiar user interface to users who are
experienced in CUDA but relatively new to the ROCm/HIP development environment.
On the other hand, amdclang++ provides a user interface identical to the clang++
compiler. It is more suitable for experienced developers who want to directly
interact with the clang compiler and gain full control of their application’s
build process.

The major differences between hipcc and amdclang++ are listed below:

### AMD Optimizations for Zen Architectures

The CPU compiler optimizations described in this chapter originate from the AMD
Optimizing C/C++ Compiler (AOCC) compiler. They are available in ROCmCC if the
optional rocm-llvm-alt package is installed. The user’s interaction with the
compiler does not change once rocm-llvm-alt is installed. The user should use
the same compiler entry point, provided AMD provides high-performance compiler
optimizations for Zen-based processors in AOCC.

For more information, refer to
[https://developer.amd.com/amd-aocc/](https://developer.amd.com/amd-aocc/).

#### `-famd-opt`

Enables a default set of AMD proprietary optimizations for the AMD Zen CPU
architectures.

`-fno-amd-opt` disables the AMD proprietary optimizations.

The `-famd-opt` flag is useful when a user wants to build with the proprietary
optimization compiler and not have to depend on setting any of the other
proprietary optimization flags.

:::{note}
`-famd-opt` can be used in addition to the other proprietary CPU optimization
flags. The table of optimizations below implicitly enables the invocation of the
AMD proprietary optimizations compiler, whereas the `-famd-opt` flag requires
this to be handled explicitly.
:::

#### `-fstruct-layout=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`

Analyzes the whole program to determine if the structures in the code can be
peeled and the pointer or integer fields in the structure can be compressed. If
feasible, this optimization transforms the code to enable these improvements.
This transformation is likely to improve cache utilization and memory bandwidth.
It is expected to improve the scalability of programs executed on multiple cores.

This is effective only under `flto`, as the whole program analysis is required
to perform this optimization. Users can choose different levels of
aggressiveness with which this optimization can be applied to the application,
with 1 being the least aggressive and 7 being the most aggressive level.


:::{table} -fstruct-layout Values and Their Effects
| -fstruct-layout value | Structure peeling | Pointer size after selective compression of self-referential pointers in structures, wherever safe | Type of structure fields eligible for compression | Whether compression performed under safety check |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Enabled | NA | NA | NA |
| 2 | Enabled | 32-bit | NA | NA |
| 3 | Enabled | 16-bit | NA | NA |
| 4 | Enabled | 32-bit | Integer | Yes |
| 5 | Enabled | 16-bit | Integer | Yes |
| 6 | Enabled | 32-bit | 64-bit signed int or unsigned int. Users must ensure that the values assigned to 64-bit signed int fields are in range -(2^31 - 1) to +(2^31 - 1) and 64-bit unsigned int fields are in the range 0 to +(2^31 - 1). Otherwise, you may obtain incorrect results. | No. Users must ensure the safety based on the program compiled. |
| 7 | Enabled | 16-bit | 64-bit signed int or unsigned int. Users must ensure that the values assigned to 64-bit signed int fields are in range -(2^31 - 1) to +(2^31 - 1) and 64-bit unsigned int fields are in the range 0 to +(2^31 - 1). Otherwise, you may obtain incorrect results. | No. Users must ensure the safety based on the program compiled. |
:::

#### `-fitodcalls`

Promotes indirect-to-direct calls by placing conditional calls. Application or
benchmarks that have a small and deterministic set of target functions for
function pointers passed as call parameters benefit from this optimization.
Indirect-to-direct call promotion transforms the code to use all possible
determined targets under runtime checks and falls back to the original code for
all the other cases. Runtime checks are introduced by the compiler for each of
these possible function pointer targets followed by direct calls to the targets.

This is a link time optimization, which is invoked as `-flto -fitodcalls`

#### `-fitodcallsbyclone`

Performs value specialization for functions with function pointers passed as an
argument. It does this specialization by generating a clone of the function. The
cloning of the function happens in the call chain as needed, to allow conversion
of indirect function call to direct call.

This complements `-fitodcalls` optimization and is also a link time
optimization, which is invoked as `-flto -fitodcallsbyclone`.

#### `-fremap-arrays`

Transforms the data layout of a single dimensional array to provide better cache
locality. This optimization is effective only under `flto`, as the whole program
needs to be analyzed to perform this optimization, which can be invoked as
`-flto -fremap-arrays`.

#### `-finline-aggressive`

Enables improved inlining capability through better heuristics. This
optimization is more effective when used with `flto`, as the whole program
analysis is required to perform this optimization, which can be invoked as
`-flto -finline-aggressive`.

#### `-fnt-store (non-temporal store)`

Generates a non-temporal store instruction for array accesses in a loop with a
large trip count.

#### `-fnt-store=aggressive`

This is an experimental option to generate non-temporal store instruction for
array accesses in a loop, whose iteration count cannot be determined at compile
time. In this case, the compiler assumes the iteration count to be huge.

#### Optimizations Through Driver `-mllvm <options>`

The following optimization options must be invoked through driver
`-mllvm <options>`:

##### `-enable-partial-unswitch`

Enables partial loop unswitching, which is an enhancement to the existing loop
unswitching optimization in LLVM. Partial loop unswitching hoists a condition
inside a loop from a path for which the execution condition remains invariant,
whereas the original loop unswitching works for a condition that is completely
loop invariant. The condition inside the loop gets hoisted out from the
invariant path, and the original loop is retained for the path where the
condition is variant.

##### `-aggressive-loop-unswitch`

Experimental option that enables aggressive loop unswitching heuristic
(including `-enable-partial-unswitch`) based on the usage of the branch
conditional values. Loop unswitching leads to code bloat. Code bloat can be
minimized if the hoisted condition is executed more often. This heuristic
prioritizes the conditions based on the number of times they are used within the
loop. The heuristic can be controlled with the following options:

- `-unswitch-identical-branches-min-count=<n>`
  - Enables unswitching of a loop with respect to a branch conditional value
    (B), where B appears in at least `<n>` compares in the loop. This option is
    enabled with `-aggressive-loop-unswitch`. The default value is 3.

  **Usage:** `-mllvm -aggressive-loop-unswitch -mllvm -unswitch-identical-branches-min-count=<n>`

  Where, `n` is a positive integer and lower value of `<n>` facilitates more
  unswitching.
- `-unswitch-identical-branches-max-count=<n>`
  - Enables unswitching of a loop with respect to a branch conditional value
    (B), where B appears in at most `<n>` compares in the loop. This option is
    enabled with `-aggressive-loop-unswitch`. The default value is 6.

  **Usage:** `-mllvm -aggressive-loop-unswitch -mllvm -unswitch-identical-branches-max-count=<n>`

  Where, `n` is a positive integer and higher value of `<n>` facilitates more unswitching.

   :::{note}
   These options may facilitate more unswitching under some workloads. Since
   loop-unswitching inherently leads to code bloat, facilitating more
   unswitching may significantly increase the code size. Hence, it may also lead
   to longer compilation times.
   :::

##### `-enable-strided-vectorization`

Enables strided memory vectorization as an enhancement to the interleaved
vectorization framework present in LLVM. It enables the effective use of gather
and scatter kind of instruction patterns. This flag must be used along with the
interleave vectorization flag.

##### `-enable-epilog-vectorization`

Enables vectorization of epilog-iterations as an enhancement to existing
vectorization framework. This enables generation of an additional epilog vector
loop version for the remainder iterations of the original vector loop. The
vector size or factor of the original loop should be large enough to allow an
effective epilog vectorization of the remaining iterations. This optimization
takes place only when the original vector loop is vectorized with a vector width
or factor of 16. This vectorization width of 16 may be overwritten by
`-min-width-epilog-vectorization` command-line option.

##### `-enable-redundant-movs`

Removes any redundant mov operations including redundant loads from memory and
stores to memory. This can be invoked using
`-Wl,-plugin-opt=-enable-redundant-movs`.

##### `-merge-constant`

Attempts to promote frequently occurring constants to registers. The aim is to
reduce the size of the instruction encoding for instructions using constants and
obtain a performance improvement.

##### `-function-specialize`

Optimizes the functions with compile time constant formal arguments.

##### `-lv-function-specialization`

Generates specialized function versions when the loops inside function are
vectorizable and the arguments are not aliased with each other.

##### `-enable-vectorize-compares`

Enables vectorization on certain loops with conditional breaks assuming the
memory accesses are safely bound within the page boundary.

##### `-inline-recursion=[1,2,3,4]`

Enables inlining for recursive functions based on heuristics where the
aggressiveness of heuristics increases with the level (1-4). The default level
is 2. Higher levels may lead to code bloat due to expansion of recursive
functions at call sites.

:::{table} -inline-recursion Level and Their Effects
| `-inline-recursion` **value** | **Inline depth of heuristics used to enable inlining for recursive functions** |
|:-----------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 1                             | 1                                                                              |
| 2                             | 1                                                                              |
| 3                             | 1                                                                              |
| 4                             | 10                                                                             |
:::

This is more effective with flto as the whole program needs to be analyzed to
perform this optimization, which can be invoked as
`-flto -inline-recursion=[1,2,3,4]`.

##### `-reduce-array-computations=[1,2,3]`

Performs array dataflow analysis and optimizes the unused array computations.

:::{table} -reduce-array-computations Values and Their Effects
| -reduce-array-computations value | Array elements eligible for elimination of computations |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1                                | Unused                      |
| 2                                | Zero valued                 |
| 3                                | Both unused and zero valued |
:::

This optimization is effective with flto as the whole program needs to be
analyzed to perform this optimization, which can be invoked as
`-flto -reduce-array-computations=[1,2,3]`.

##### `-global-vectorize-slp={true,false}`

Vectorizes the straight-line code inside a basic block with data reordering
vector operations. This option is set to **true** by default.

##### `-region-vectorize`

Experimental flag for enabling vectorization on certain loops with complex
control flow, which the normal vectorizer cannot handle.

This optimization is effective with flto as the whole program needs to be
analyzed to perform this optimization, which can be invoked as
`-flto -region-vectorize`.

##### `-enable-x86-prefetching`

Enables the generation of x86 prefetch instruction for the memory references
inside a loop or inside an innermost loop of a loop nest to prefetch the second
dimension of multidimensional array/memory references in the innermost loop of a
loop nest. This is an experimental pass; its profitability is being improved.

##### `-suppress-fmas`

Identifies the reduction patterns on FMA and suppresses the FMA generation, as
it is not profitable on the reduction patterns.

##### `-enable-icm-vrp`

Enables estimation of the virtual register pressure before performing loop
invariant code motion. This estimation is used to control the number of loop
invariants that will be hoisted during the loop invariant code motion.

##### `-loop-splitting`

Enables splitting of loops into multiple loops to eliminate the branches, which
compare the loop induction with an invariant or constant expression. This option
is enabled under `-O3` by default. To disable this optimization, use
`-loop-splitting=false`.

##### `-enable-ipo-loop-split`

Enables splitting of loops into multiple loops to eliminate the branches, which
compares the loop induction with a constant expression. This constant expression
can be derived through inter-procedural analysis. This option is enabled under
`-O3` by default. To disable this optimization, use
`-enable-ipo-loop-split=false`.

##### `-compute-interchange-order`

Enables heuristic for finding the best possible interchange order for a loop
nest. To enable this option, use `-enable-loopinterchange`. This option is set
to **false** by default.

**Usage:**

```bash
-mllvm -enable-loopinterchange -mllvm -compute-interchange-order
```

##### `-convert-pow-exp-to-int={true,false}`

Converts the call to floating point exponent version of pow to its integer
exponent version if the floating-point exponent can be converted to integer.
This option is set to **true** by default.

##### `-do-lock-reordering={none,normal,aggressive}`

Reorders the control predicates in increasing order of complexity from outer
predicate to inner when it is safe. The **normal** mode reorders simple
expressions, while the **aggressive** mode reorders predicates involving
function calls if no side effects are determined. This option is set to
**normal** by default.

##### `-fuse-tile-inner-loop`

Enables fusion of adjacent tiled loops as a part of loop tiling transformation.
This option is set to false by default.

##### `-Hz,1,0x1 [Fortran]`

Helps to preserve array index information for array access expressions which get
linearized in the compiler frontend. The preserved information is used by the
compiler optimization phase in performing optimizations such as loop
transformations. It is recommended that any user who is using optimizations
such as loop transformations and other optimizations requiring de-linearized
index expressions should use the Hz option. This option has no impact on any
other aspects of the Flang frontend.

### Inline ASM Statements

Inline assembly (ASM) statements allow a developer to include assembly
instructions directly in either host or device code. While the ROCm compiler
supports ASM statements, their use is not recommended for the following reasons:

- The compiler's ability to produce both correct code and to optimize
  surrounding code is impeded.
- The compiler does not parse the content of the ASM statements and so
  cannot "see" its contents.
- The compiler must make conservative assumptions in an effort to retain
  correctness.
- The conservative assumptions may yield code that, on the whole, is less
  performant compared to code without ASM statements. It is possible that a
  syntactically correct ASM statement may cause incorrect runtime behavior.
- ASM statements are often ASIC-specific; code containing them is less portable
  and adds a maintenance burden to the developer if different ASICs are
  targeted.
- Writing correct ASM statements is often difficult; we strongly recommend
  thorough testing of any use of ASM statements.

:::{note}
For developers who choose to include ASM statements in the code, AMD is
interested in understanding the use case and appreciates feedback at
[https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/issues](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/issues)
:::

### Miscellaneous OpenMP Compiler Features

This section discusses features that have been added or enhanced in the OpenMP
compiler.

#### Offload-arch Tool

An LLVM library and tool that is used to query the execution capability of the
current system as well as to query requirements of a binary file. It is used by
OpenMP device runtime to ensure compatibility of an image with the current
system while loading it. It is compatible with TargetID support and multi-image
fat binary support.

**Usage:**

```bash
offload-arch [Options] [Optional lookup-value]
```

When used without an option, offload-arch prints the value of the first offload
arch found in the underlying system. This can be used by various clang
frontends. For example, to compile for OpenMP offloading on your current system,
invoke clang with the following command:

```bash
clang -fopenmp -fopenmp-targets=`offload-arch` foo.c
```

If an optional lookup-value is specified, offload-arch will check if the value
is either a valid offload-arch or a codename and look up requested additional
information.

The following command provides all the information for offload-arch gfx906:

```bash
offload-arch gfx906 -v
```

The options are listed below:

:::{program} offload-arch
:::{option} -h
  Prints the help message.
:::

:::{option} -a
  Prints values for all devices. Do not stop at the first device found.
:::

:::{option} -m
  Prints device code name (often found in pci.ids file).
:::

:::{option} -n
  Prints numeric pci-id.
:::

:::{option} -t
   Prints clang offload triple to use for the offload arch.
:::

:::{option} -v
  Verbose. Implies: `-a -m -n -t`. For: all devices, prints codename, numeric value, and triple.
:::

:::{option} -f <file>
   Prints offload requirements including offload-arch for each compiled offload image built into an application binary file.
:::

:::{option} -c
  Prints offload capabilities of the underlying system. This option is used by the language runtime to select an image when multiple images are available. A capability must exist for each requirement of the selected image.
:::

There are symbolic link aliases amdgpu-offload-arch and nvidia-arch for
offload-arch. These aliases return 1 if no amdgcn GPU or cuda GPU is found.
These aliases are useful in determining whether architecture-specific tests
should be run or to conditionally load architecture-specific software.

#### Command-Line Simplification Using offload-arch Flag

Legacy mechanism of specifying offloading target for OpenMP involves using three
flags, `-fopenmp-targets`, `-Xopenmp-target`, and `-march`. The first two flags
take a target triple (like `amdgcn-amd-amdhsa` or `nvptx64-nvidia-cuda`), while
the last flag takes device name (like `gfx908` or `sm_70`) as input.
Alternatively, users of ROCmCC compiler can use the flag `—offload-arch` for a
combined effect of the above three flags.

**Example:**

```bash
# Legacy mechanism
clang -fopenmp -target x86_64-linux-gnu \
-fopenmp-targets=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa \
-march=gfx906 helloworld.c -o helloworld
```

**Example:**

```bash
# Using offload-arch flag
clang -fopenmp -target x86_64-linux-gnu \
--offload-arch=gfx906 helloworld.c -o helloworld.
```

To ensure backward compatibility, both styles are supported. This option is
compatible with TargetID support and multi-image fat binaries.

#### TargetID Support for OpenMP

The ROCmCC compiler supports specification of target features along with the GPU
name while specifying a target offload device in the command line, using
`-march` or `--offload-arch` options. The compiled image in such cases is
specialized for a given configuration of device and target features (TargetID).

**Example:**

```bash
# compiling for a gfx908 device with XNACK paging support turned ON
clang -fopenmp -target x86_64-linux-gnu \
-fopenmp-targets=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa \
-march=gfx908:xnack+ helloworld.c -o helloworld
```

**Example:**

```bash
# compiling for a gfx908 device with SRAMECC support turned OFF
clang -fopenmp -target x86_64-linux-gnu \
-fopenmp-targets=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa \
-march=gfx908:sramecc- helloworld.c -o helloworld
```

**Example:**

```bash
# compiling for a gfx908 device with SRAMECC support turned ON and XNACK paging support turned OFF
clang -fopenmp -target x86_64-linux-gnu \
-fopenmp-targets=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa \
-march=gfx908:sramecc+:xnack- helloworld.c -o helloworld
```

The TargetID specified on the command line is passed to the clang driver using
target-feature flag, to the LLVM optimizer and backend using `-mattr` flag, and
to linker using `-plugin-opt=-mattr` flag. This feature is compatible with
offload-arch command-line option and multi-image binaries for multiple
architectures.

#### Multi-image Fat Binary for OpenMP

The ROCmCC compiler is enhanced to generate binaries that can contain
heterogenous images. This heterogeneity could be in terms of:

- Images of different architectures, like amdgcn and nvptx
- Images of same architectures but for different GPUs, like gfx906 and gfx908
- Images of same architecture and same GPU but for different target features,
  like gfx908:xnack+ and gfx908:xnack-

An appropriate image is selected by the OpenMP device runtime for execution
depending on the capability of the current system. This feature is compatible
with TargetID support and offload-arch command-line options and uses
offload-arch tool to determine capability of the current system.

**Example:**

```bash
clang -fopenmp -target x86_64-linux-gnu \
-fopenmp-targets=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa,amdgcn-amd-amdhsa \
-Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -march=gfx906 \
-Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -march=gfx908 \
helloworld.c -o helloworld
```

**Example:**

```bash
clang -fopenmp -target x86_64-linux-gnu \
--offload-arch=gfx906 \
--offload-arch=gfx908 \
helloworld.c -o helloworld
```

**Example:**

```bash
clang -fopenmp -target x86_64-linux-gnu \
-fopenmp-targets=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa,amdgcn-amd-amdhsa,amdgcn-amd-amdhsa,amdgcn-amd-amdhsa \
-Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -march=gfx908:sramecc+:xnack+ \
-Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -march=gfx908:sramecc-:xnack+ \
-Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -march=gfx908:sramecc+:xnack- \
-Xopenmp-target=amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -march=gfx908:sramecc-:xnack- \
helloworld.c -o helloworld
```

The ROCmCC compiler creates an instance of toolchain for each unique combination
of target triple and the target GPU (along with the associated target features).
`clang-offload-wrapper` tool is modified to insert a new structure
`__tgt_image_info` along with each image in the binary. Device runtime is also
modified to query this structure to identify a compatible image based on the
capability of the current system.

#### Unified Shared Memory (USM)

The following OpenMP pragma is available on MI200, and it must be executed with
xnack+ support.

```cpp
omp requires unified_shared_memory
```
