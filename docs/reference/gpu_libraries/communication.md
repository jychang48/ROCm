RCCL (pronounced "Rickle") is a stand-alone library of standard collective communication routines for GPUs,
implementing all-reduce, all-gather, reduce, broadcast, reduce-scatter, gather, scatter, and all-to-all.
The collective operations are implemented using ring and tree algorithms and have been optimized for
throughput and latency.
