# C++ Primitive Libraries
ROCm template libraries for algorithms are as follows:

:::{grid-item-card} [rocPRIM](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/projects/rocPRIM/en/latest/)
rocPRIM is an AMD GPU optimized template library of algorithm primitives, like
transforms, reductions, scans, etc. It also serves as a common back-end for
similar libraries found inside ROCm.

:::{grid-item-card} [rocThrust](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/projects/rocThrust/en/latest/)
rocThrust is a template library of algorithm primitives with a Thrust-compatible
interface. Their CPU back-ends are identical, while the GPU back-end calls into
rocPRIM.

:::{grid-item-card} [hipCUB](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/projects/hipCUB/en/latest/)
hipCUB is a template library of algorithm primitives with a CUB-compatible
interface. It's back-end is rocPRIM.
