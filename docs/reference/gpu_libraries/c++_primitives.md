# C++ Primitives

ROCm template libraries for algorithms are as follows:

:::::{grid} 1 1 3 3
:gutter: 1

:::{grid-item-card} rocPRIM
rocPRIM is an AMD GPU optimized template library of algorithm primitives, like
transforms, reductions, scans, etc. It also serves as a common back-end for
similar libraries found inside ROCm.

:::{grid-item-card} rocThrust
rocThrust is a template library of algorithm primitives with a Thrust-compatible
interface. Their CPU back-ends are identical, while the GPU back-end calls into
rocPRIM.

:::{grid-item-card} hipCUB
hipCUB is a template library of algorithm primitives with a CUB-compatible
interface. It's back-end is rocPRIM.
