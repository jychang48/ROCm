# Prerequisites (Linux)

You must perform the following steps before installing ROCm and check if the
system meets all the requirements to proceed with the installation.

## Confirm the System Has a Supported Linux Distribution Version

The ROCm installation is supported only on specific Linux distributions and
kernel versions.

### Check the Linux Distribution and Kernel Version on Your System

This section discusses obtaining information about the Linux distribution and
kernel version.

#### Linux Distribution Information

Verify the Linux distribution using the following steps:

1. To obtain the Linux distribution information, type the following command on
your system from the Command Line Interface (CLI):

   ```shell
   uname -m && cat /etc/*release
   ```

2. Confirm that the obtained Linux distribution information matches with those
with [System Requirements](/release/gpu_os_support#os-support).

   **Example:** Running the command above on an Ubuntu system results in the
   following output:

   ```shell
   x86_64
   DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
   DISTRIB_RELEASE=20.04
   DISTRIB_CODENAME=focal
   DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS"
   ```

#### Kernel Information

Verify the kernel version using the following steps:

1. To check the kernel version of your Linux system, type the following command:

   ```shell
   uname -srmv
   ```

2. Confirm that the obtained kernel version information matches with System
Requirements.

   **Example:** The output of the command above lists the kernel version in the
   following format:

   ```shell
   Linux 5.15.0-46-generic #44~20.04.5-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jun 24 13:27:29 UTC 2022 x86_64
   ```

## Confirm the System has a ROCm-Capable GPU

The ROCm platform is designed to support the following GPUs:

```{table} GPU Support for ROCm Programming Models
:name: gpu-support
| **Classification** | **GPU Name**              | **GFX ID** | **Product Id** |
|:------------------:|:-------------------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|
| **GFX9 GPUs**      | AMD Radeon Instinct™ MI50 | gfx906     | Vega 20        |
| **GFX9 GPUs**      | AMD Radeon Instinct™ MI60 | gfx906     | Vega 20        |
| **GFX9 GPUs**      | AMD Radeon™ VII           | gfx906     | Vega 20        |
| **GFX9 GPUs**      | AMD Radeon™ Pro VII       | gfx906     | Vega 20        |
| **RDNA GPUs**      | AMD Radeon™ Pro W6800     | gfx1030    | Navi 21 GL-XL  |
| **RDNA GPUs**      | AMD Radeon™ Pro V620      | gfx1030    | Navi 21 GL-XE  |
| **CDNA GPUs**      | AMD Instinct™ MI100       | gfx908     | Arcturus       |
| **CDNA GPUs**      | AMD Instinct™ MI200       | gfx90a     | Aldebaran      |
```

### Verify Your System Has a ROCm-Capable GPU

To verify that your system has a ROCm-capable GPU, use these steps:

1. Enter the following command from the Command Line Interface (CLI):

   ```shell
   lspci | grep -i display
   ```

   The command displays the details of detected GPUs on the system in the
   following format in the case of AMD Instinct™ MI200:

   ```shell
   c1:00.0 Display controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Aldebaran
   c5:00.0 Display controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Aldebaran
   ```

2. Verify from the output that the listed product names match with the Product
Id given in the table above.

## Confirm the System Has All the Required Tools and Packages Installed

Register the appropriate repositories in the system's package manager as shown
in the
[Linux Quick Start Guide](how_to/quick_start_linux.html#add-repositories).

### Setting Permissions for Groups

This section provides steps to add any current user to a video group to access
GPU resources.

1. To check the groups in your system, issue the following command:

   ```shell
   groups
   ```

2. Add yourself to the render or video group using the following instruction:

   ```shell
   sudo usermod -a -G render $LOGNAME
   # OR
   sudo usermod -a -G video $LOGNAME
   ```

3. Use of the video group is recommended for all ROCm-supported operating
systems.

   ```{note}
   render group is required only for Ubuntu v20.04.
   ```

   To add future users to the video and render groups, run the following command:

   ```shell
   echo 'ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/adduser.conf
   echo 'EXTRA_GROUPS=video' | sudo tee -a /etc/adduser.conf
   echo 'EXTRA_GROUPS=render' | sudo tee -a /etc/adduser.conf
   ```
