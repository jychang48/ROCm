## Changes in This Release

### Ubuntu 18.04 End of Life

Support for Ubuntu 18.04 ends in this release. Future releases of ROCm will not
provide prebuilt packages for Ubuntu 18.04.

### HIP and Other Runtimes

#### HIP Runtime

##### Fixes

- A bug was discovered in the HIP graph capture implementation in the ROCm
  v5.2.0 release. If the same kernel is called twice (with different argument
  values) in a graph capture, the implementation only kept the argument values
  for the second kernel call.
- A bug was introduced in the `hiprtc` implementation in the ROCm v5.2.0
  release. This bug caused the `hiprtcGetLoweredName` call to fail for named
  expressions with whitespace in it.

**Example:** The named expression `my_sqrt<complex<double>>` passed but
`my_sqrt<complex<double>>` failed.

### ROCm Libraries

#### RCCL

##### Added

- Compatibility with NCCL 2.12.10
- Packages for test and benchmark executables on all supported OSes using CPack
- Adding custom signal handler - opt-in with `RCCL_ENABLE_SIGNALHANDLER=1`
  - Additional details provided if Binary File Descriptor library (BFD) is
    pre-installed.
  - Adding experimental support for using multiple ranks per device
    - Requires using a new interface to create communicator
      (`ncclCommInitRankMulti`), refer to the interface documentation for
      details.
    - To avoid potential deadlocks, user might have to set an environment
      variables increasing the number of hardware queues. For example,

```cpp
export GPU_MAX_HW_QUEUES=16
```

- Adding support for reusing ports in NET/IB channels
  - Opt-in with `NCCL_IB_SOCK_CLIENT_PORT_REUSE=1` and
    `NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE=1`
    - When "`Call to bind failed: Address already in use`" error happens in
      large-scale AlltoAll (for example, >=64 MI200 nodes), users are suggested
      to opt-in either one or both of the options to resolve the massive port
      usage issue
    - Avoid using `NCCL_IB_SOCK_SERVER_PORT_REUSE` when
      `NCCL_NCHANNELS_PER_NET_PEER` is tuned >1

##### Removed

- Removed experimental clique-based kernels
