### AMD ROCm™ v5.0.2 Release Notes

#### Fixed Defects in This Release

The following defects are fixed in the ROCm v5.0.2 release.

##### Issue with hostcall Facility in HIP Runtime

In ROCm v5.0, when using the `assert()` call in a HIP kernel, the compiler may
sometimes fail to emit kernel metadata related to the hostcall facility, which
results in incomplete initialization of the hostcall facility in the HIP
runtime. This can cause the HIP kernel to crash when it attempts to execute the
`assert()` call. The root cause was an incorrect check in the compiler to
determine whether the hostcall facility is required by the kernel. This is fixed
in the ROCm v5.0.2 release. The resolution includes a compiler change, which
emits the required metadata by default, unless the compiler can prove that the
hostcall facility is not required by the kernel. This ensures that the
`assert()` call never fails.

**Note**: This fix may lead to breakage in some OpenMP offload use cases, which
use print inside a target region and result in an abort in device code.
The issue will be fixed in a future release.

##### Compatibility Matrix Updates to ROCm Deep Learning Guide

The compatibility matrix in the AMD Deep Learning Guide is updated for ROCm
v5.0.2.

### AMD ROCm™ v5.0.1 Release Notes

#### Deprecations and Warnings

##### Refactor of HIPCC/HIPCONFIG

In prior ROCm releases, by default, the `hipcc`/`hipconfig` Perl scripts were
used to identify and set target compiler options, target platform, compiler, and
runtime appropriately.

In ROCm v5.0.1, `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` have been added as the compiled
binary implementations of the `hipcc` and `hipconfig`. These new binaries are
currently a work-in-progress, considered, and marked as experimental. ROCm plans
to fully transition to `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` in the a future ROCm
release. The existing `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are renamed to
`hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl` respectively. New top-level `hipcc` and
`hipconfig` Perl scripts are created, which can switch between the Perl script
or the compiled binary based on the environment variable
`HIPCC_USE_PERL_SCRIPT`.

In ROCm 5.0.1, by default, this environment variable is set to use `hipcc` and
`hipconfig` through the Perl scripts. Subsequently, Perl scripts will no longer
be available in ROCm in a future release.

## What's New in This Release

### HIP Enhancements

The ROCm v5.0 release consists of the following HIP enhancements.

#### HIP Installation Guide Updates

The HIP Installation Guide is updated to include building HIP from source on the
NVIDIA platform.

Refer to the HIP Installation Guide v5.0 for more details.

#### Managed Memory Allocation

Managed memory, including the `__managed__` keyword, is now supported in the HIP
combined host/device compilation. Through unified memory allocation, managed
memory allows data to be shared and accessible to both the CPU and GPU using a
single pointer. The allocation is managed by the AMD GPU driver using the Linux
Heterogeneous Memory Management (HMM) mechanism. The user can call managed
memory API `hipMallocManaged` to allocate a large chunk of HMM memory, execute
kernels on a device, and fetch data between the host and device as needed.

**Note:** In a HIP application, it is recommended to do a capability check
before calling the managed memory APIs. For example,

```cpp
int managed_memory = 0;
HIPCHECK(hipDeviceGetAttribute(&managed_memory, hipDeviceAttributeManagedMemory, p_gpuDevice));

if (!managed_memory) {
  printf ("info: managed memory access not supported on the device %d\n Skipped\n", p_gpuDevice);
} else {
  HIPCHECK(hipSetDevice(p_gpuDevice));
  HIPCHECK(hipMallocManaged(&Hmm, N * sizeof(T)));
  . . .
}
```

**Note:** The managed memory capability check may not be necessary; however, if
HMM is not supported, managed `malloc` will fall back to using system memory.

Refer to the HIP API documentation for more details on managed memory APIs.

For the application, see
[hipMallocManaged.cpp](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/blob/rocm-4.5.x/tests/src/runtimeApi/memory/hipMallocManaged.cpp)

### New Environment Variable

The following new environment variable is added in this release:

| **Environment Variable** | **Value**             | **Description**                                         |
|:------------------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------|
| `HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT`      | 0 or 1 (default is 0) | Some processors support more compute units than can reliably be used in a cooperative dispatch. Setting the environment variable `HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT` to 1 will cause ROCr to return the correct CU count for cooperative groups through the `HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT` attribute of `hsa_agent_get_info()`. Setting `HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT` to other values, or leaving it unset, will cause ROCr to return the same CU count for the attributes `HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COOPERATIVE_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT` and `HSA_AMD_AGENT_INFO_COMPUTE_UNIT_COUNT`. Future ROCm releases will make `HSA_COOP_CU_COUNT = 1` the default. |

### System Management Interface

#### Clock Throttling for GPU Events

This feature lists GPU events as they occur in real-time and can be used with
`kfdtest` to produce `vm_fault` events for testing.

The command can be called with either `-e` or `--showevents` like this:

```bash
-e [EVENT [EVENT ...]], --showevents [EVENT [EVENT ...]]  Show event list
```

Where `EVENT` is any list combination of `VM_FAULT`, `THERMAL_THROTTLE`, or
`GPU_RESET` and is **NOT** case sensitive.

**Note:** If no event arguments are passed, all events will be watched by
default.

##### CLI Commands

```bash
$ rocm-smi --showevents vm_fault thermal_throttle gpu_reset

======================= ROCm System Management Interface =======================
================================= Show Events ==================================
press 'q' or 'ctrl + c' to quit
DEVICE    TIME    TYPE    DESCRIPTION

============================= End of ROCm SMI Log ==============================
```

(Run `kfdtest` in another window to test for `vm_fault` events.)

**Note:** Unlike other rocm-smi CLI commands, this command does not quit unless
specified by the user. Users may press either `q` or `ctrl + c` to quit.

#### Display XGMI Bandwidth Between Nodes

The `rsmi_minmax_bandwidth_get` API reads the HW Topology file and displays
bandwidth (min-max) between any two NUMA nodes in a matrix format.

The Command Line Interface (CLI) command can be called as follows:

```bash
$ rocm-smi --shownodesbw

======================= ROCm System Management Interface =======================
================================== Bandwidth ===================================
GPU0 GPU1 GPU2 GPU3 GPU4 GPU5 GPU6 GPU7
GPU0 N/A 50000-200000 50000-50000 0-0 0-0 0-0 50000-100000 0-0
GPU1 50000-200000 N/A 0-0 50000-50000 0-0 50000-50000 0-0 0-0
GPU2 50000-50000 0-0 N/A 50000-200000 50000-100000 0-0 0-0 0-0
GPU3 0-0 50000-50000 50000-200000 N/A 0-0 0-0 0-0 50000-50000
GPU4 0-0 0-0 50000-100000 0-0 N/A 50000-200000 50000-50000 0-0
GPU5 0-0 50000-50000 0-0 0-0 50000-200000 N/A 0-0 50000-50000
GPU6 50000-100000 0-0 0-0 0-0 50000-50000 0-0 N/A 50000-200000

Format: min-max; Units: mps
============================= End of ROCm SMI Log ==============================
```

The sample output above shows the maximum theoretical xgmi bandwidth between 2
numa nodes,

**Note:** "0-0" min-max bandwidth indicates devices are not connected directly.

#### P2P Connection Status

The `rsmi_is_p2p_accessible` API returns `True` if P2P can be implemented
between two nodes, and returns `False` if P2P cannot be implemented between the
two nodes.

The Command Line Interface command can be called as follows:

```bash
rocm-smi --showtopoaccess
```

Sample Output:

```bash
$ rocm-smi --showtopoaccess
======================= ROCm System Management Interface =======================
===================== Link accessibility between two GPUs ======================
GPU0 GPU1
GPU0 True True
GPU1 True True

## Breaking Changes

### Runtime Breaking Change

Re-ordering of the enumerated type in `hip_runtime_api.h` to better match CUDA.
See below for the difference in enumerated types.

ROCm software will be affected if any of the defined enums listed below are used
in the code. Applications built with ROCm v5.0 enumerated types will work with a
ROCm 4.5.2 driver. However, an undefined behavior error will occur with a ROCm
v4.5.2 application that uses these enumerated types with a ROCm 5.0 runtime.

## Known Issues in This Release

### Incorrect dGPU Behavior When Using AMDVBFlash Tool

The AMDVBFlash tool, used for flashing the VBIOS image to dGPU, does not
communicate with the ROM Controller specifically when the driver is present.
This is because the driver, as part of its runtime power management feature,
puts the dGPU to a sleep state.

As a workaround, users can run `amdgpu.runpm=0`, which temporarily disables the
runtime power management feature from the driver and dynamically changes some
power control-related sysfs files.

### Issue with START Timestamp in ROCProfiler

Users may encounter an issue with the enabled timestamp functionality for
monitoring one or multiple counters. ROCProfiler outputs the following four
timestamps for each kernel:

- Dispatch
- Start
- End
- Complete

#### Issue

This defect is related to the Start timestamp functionality, which incorrectly
shows an earlier time than the Dispatch timestamp.

To reproduce the issue,

1. Enable timing using the `--timestamp on` flag.
2. Use the `-i` option with the input filename that contains the name of the
   counter(s) to monitor.
3. Run the program.
4. Check the output result file.

##### Current behavior

`BeginNS` is lower than `DispatchNS`, which is incorrect.

##### Expected behavior

The correct order is:

`Dispatch < Start < End < Complete`

Users cannot use ROCProfiler to measure the time spent on each kernel because of
the incorrect timestamp with counter collection enabled.

##### Recommended Workaround

Users are recommended to collect kernel execution timestamps without monitoring
counters, as follows:

1. Enable timing using the `--timestamp on` flag, and run the application.
2. Rerun the application using the `-i` option with the input filename that
   contains the name of the counter(s) to monitor, and save this to a different
   output file using the `-o` flag.
3. Check the output result file from step 1.
4. The order of timestamps correctly displays as:

`DispathNS < BeginNS < EndNS < CompleteNS`

1. Users can find the values of the collected counters in the output file
   generated in step 2.

### No Support for SMI and ROCDebugger on SRIOV

System Management Interface (SMI) and ROCDebugger are not supported in the SRIOV
environment on any GPU, including the
**Radeon Pro V620 and W6800 Workstation GPUs**. For more information, refer to
the Systems Management Interface documentation.

## Deprecations and Warnings in This Release

### ROCm Libraries Changes – Deprecations and Deprecation Removal

- The `hipfft.h` header is now provided only by the `hipfft` package. Up to ROCm
  5.0, users would get `hipfft.h` in the rocfft package too.
- The GlobalPairwiseAMG class is now entirely removed, users should use the
  PairwiseAMG class instead.
- The `rocsparse_spmm` signature in 5.0 was changed to match that of
  `rocsparse_spmm_ex`. In 5.0, `rocsparse_spmm_ex` is still present, but
  deprecated. Signature diff for `rocsparse_spmm`

### HIP API Deprecations and Warnings

#### Warning - Arithmetic Operators of HIP Complex and Vector Types

In this release, arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types are
deprecated.

- As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP complex types, users can use
  arithmetic operators of `std::complex` types.
- As alternatives to arithmetic operators of HIP vector types, users can use the
  operators of the native clang vector type associated with the data member of
  HIP vector types.

During the deprecation, two macros `__HIP_ENABLE_COMPLEX_OPERATORS` and
`__HIP_ENABLE_VECTOR_OPERATORS` are provided to allow users to conditionally
enable arithmetic operators of HIP complex or vector types.

Note, the two macros are mutually exclusive and, by default, set to off.

The arithmetic operators of HIP complex and vector types will be removed in a
future release.

Refer to the HIP API Guide for more information.

#### HIPCC/HIPCONFIG Refactoring

In prior ROCm releases, by default, the `hipcc`/`hipconfig` Perl scripts were
used to identify and set target compiler options, target platform, compiler, and
runtime appropriately.

In ROCm v5.0, `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` have been added as the compiled
binary implementations of the `hipcc` and `hipconfig`. These new binaries are
currently a work-in-progress, considered, and marked as experimental. ROCm plans
to fully transition to `hipcc.bin` and `hipconfig.bin` in the a future ROCm
release. The existing `hipcc` and `hipconfig` Perl scripts are renamed to
`hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl` respectively. New top-level `hipcc` and
`hipconfig` Perl scripts are created, which can switch between the Perl script
or the compiled binary based on the environment variable
`HIPCC_USE_PERL_SCRIPT`.

In ROCm 5.0, by default, this environment variable is set to use `hipcc` and
`hipconfig` through the Perl scripts.

Subsequently, Perl scripts will no longer be available in ROCm in a future
release.

### Warning - Compiler-Generated Code Object Version 4 Deprecation

Support for loading compiler-generated code object version 4 will be deprecated
in a future release with no release announcement and replaced with code object 5
as the default version.

The current default is code object version 4.

### Warning - MIOpenTensile Deprecation

MIOpenTensile will be deprecated in a future release.
